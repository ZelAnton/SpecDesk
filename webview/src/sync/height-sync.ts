 * Pad only the editor so each anchor lines up with the (fixed) preview, using the MINIMAL cumulative
 * padding. For anchor `i` the shift needed to bring its natural (spacer-free) editor top down to its
 * preview top is `required[i] = previewTop[i] − editorTop[i]`. Spacers can only ADD height (never
 * remove it) and stack cumulatively down the document, so the padding actually applied above anchor `i`
 * is the RUNNING MAXIMUM of `max(0, required[j])` over `j ≤ i` — the smallest non-decreasing,
 * non-negative sequence that meets each anchor's need where it is reachable and holds the accumulated
 * maximum where it is not (Code already sits at or below its target and height cannot be removed). Each
 * emitted spacer is just the INCREMENT of that running maximum across one placement slot. So where Code
 * ran ahead and Formatted only later catches back up to the already-accumulated maximum, NO new spacer
 * is added and the anchors realign — unlike the former per-gap scheme, which re-added every local
 * positive gap difference and locked that transient lead in as permanent over-padding (the bug). Where
 * alignment is genuinely unreachable (the source is intrinsically taller) the result stays monotonic
 * and never negative; the residual is bounded by the running maximum, not the sum of every local jump.
 * Pure.
 *
 * Subpixel stability. `required` and the running maximum are carried in fractional CSS px; only the
 * emitted CUMULATIVE boundaries are rounded — each spacer is `round(applied[i+1]) − round(applied[i])`,
 * the lead is `round(applied[0])` — so the total padding above any anchor `k` is exactly
 * `round(applied[k])` and per-gap rounding error can never accumulate into drift. That single rounding
 * step is the one epsilon (a half-pixel dead zone on each cumulative boundary), so a subpixel reflow
 * that does not cross a boundary recomputes the identical spacer set and {@link HeightSync.apply} stops
 * re-dispatching — no decoration flicker back and forth.
 *
 * Coordinate systems (T-061). `previewTop` and `editorTop` are each measured from their own pane's
 * scroll origin (the reference via `blockGeometry`, the editor via `naturalLineTops`); the two panes are
 * side-by-side, so those origins coincide on screen — which is what makes the per-anchor absolute
 * subtraction `previewTop − editorTop` a valid on-screen shift. But the reference pane's scroll origin
 * sits a structural `padding-top` ABOVE its content box (styles.css "Panes", `#formatted`), so every
 * `previewTop` carries that inset, and — crucially — the scroll coupling ALREADY consumes it: bringing a
 * line flush to the reference viewport scrolls the pane PAST its padding (scroll-map.ts couples through
 * `previewTop`, which includes the inset). Reproducing that same inset a SECOND time as an editor lead
 * would double-count it — the source's first line would sit the pane's `padding-top` below the rendered
 * block that the coupling has meanwhile pulled flush (the ~24 px top-of-document misalignment this fixes).
 * So the alignment is measured against the reference CONTENT box: `referenceInset` (the first rendered
 * block's own top — it hugs the content box, its first-child margin reset in styles.css §5, so its
 * scroll-relative top IS the pane's inset, read in the very same frame as every other anchor) is
 * subtracted from every `previewTop`. `required[i] = previewTop[i] − referenceInset − editorTop[i]`; the
 * lead is `applied[0] = max(0, required[0])`, which reduces to `max(0, −editorTop[0]) = 0` once the first
 * block defines the origin — no leading space is reproduced, since the reference's own padding is a scroll
 * inset, not document content. Subtracting one constant from every `previewTop` leaves the inter-anchor
 * spacers (differences of the running maximum) intact, so mid-document alignment is untouched; only the
 * spurious lead is removed. The result stays a stable fixed point because `referenceInset` and
 * `naturalLineTops[0]` are both invariant to the spacers we apply (see `MarkdownEditor.spacerHeightsAbove`),
 * so a settled geometry recomputes the identical set and {@link HeightSync.apply} stops re-dispatching — no
 * oscillation.
