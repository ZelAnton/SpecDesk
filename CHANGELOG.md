## [Unreleased]

### Added
- Initial multi-language scaffold: a .NET solution (`SpecDesk.slnx`) with C# and F# projects
  under `src/`/`tests/`, plus a TypeScript `webview/` bundle (esbuild).
- Concept and architecture documentation under `docs/design/`, and a PoC-driven execution
  plan in `docs/ROADMAP.md`.
- Cross-platform CI (Linux/Windows/macOS) building and testing the .NET solution and the
  webview, with NuGet dependency auditing, CodeQL (C# + TypeScript), and Dependabot.
- PoC-0 — native↔webview IPC: a typed JSON envelope and router (`SpecDesk.Contracts`), a
  Photino host wiring the bridge, and a webview echo round-trip correlated by message `id`.
  The `SpecDesk.Host` build now auto-bundles the webview (esbuild); skip with
  `-p:SkipWebview=true`.
